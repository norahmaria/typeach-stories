### 🚀 Start by installing with `pnpm i`

```c
// development mode for the packages
pnpm dev

// build packages
pnpm build

// run the example
cd example && pnpm peachy
```

_ps: still have some issues with allowing the example to run dynamically as the packages are changed, so sometimes you might have to refresh the app on changes._
