### 🚀 Start by installing with `pnpm i`

```c
// development mode for the packages
pnpm dev

// build packages
pnpm build

// run the example
cd example && pnpm peachy
```

_ps: still have some issues with allowing the example to run dynamically as the packages are changed, so sometimes you might have to rerun the example after changes. if that still doesn't work - manually run the build command._
