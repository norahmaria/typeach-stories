### 🚀 Start by installing with `pnpm i`

```c
// development mode for the packages
pnpm dev

// build packages
pnpm build

// run the example
cd example && pnpm peachy
```

_ps: when making changes to the peachy app, you might have to wait a bit before it'll load in dev mode, the "not found" html will automatically keep refreshing for you until it can find the app again._
